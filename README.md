# java_chat_server

This repository is a workspace used for a University project.

The main goal is to develop a chat Server using socket for network communication and threads for managing processes.
The client should be unlimited and the first step is to relay all messages to all clients.

It was built using Java 8 JDK 1.8.0_261.

This is a simple project to test socket in Java, providing only 1 server and 1 client

# Folder v1_...

This is a project that responds to the specifications, implementing also a simple protocol that allows users to send PMs, to shout, and to exit the chat.

# Folder v2_...

This is a project that provides a GUI, and allows to choose the IP/port of the server you're connecting to, giving the possibility to run distant instances.
